<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1994, St George's Hospital launched a fundraising appeal to finance the building of facilities for cancer vaccine research and to allow Professor Dalgleish to do clinical trials for a vaccine in malignant melanoma, which had only been available in the USA. The target - £500,000 - was reached in 1996 and the subsequent research showed great promise, but by 2000 it was clear additional funds were required to continue the work. The Cancer Vaccine Institute was launched in 2000 as an independent charity to continue fundraising</p>

						Andy is a research assistant who is currently doing a part-time PhD. His reseach explores how some drugs commonly used in cancer therapy can be used to stimulate the immune response. 
					</p>

					<p>
						"We used to think that chemotherapy and radiotherapy would shut down immune responses. Recently that has changed. We now believe that some drugs are beneficial when combined with vaccine treatments. However, it is necessary to understand how this happens. My work involves studying a drug called Gemcitabine which seems to have effects on tumour cells in culture that would make them more visible to the immune system. At the same time we have evidence that Gemcitabine acts on the immune system directly. This is a really exciting result since it indicates that vaccines might be better if they are combined with some standard treatments. Other studies have implied that low doses of drugs work best. That is very important because the high doses of chemotherapy that usually make patients ill, might not be necessary when used in conjunction with vaccines."

					<p>
						Gus is the professor of Oncology at St George's University of London where the majority of the CVI-funded research is carried out. He and his team do -translational" research which involves integrating basic laboratory research into new therapies for cancer. Gus has worked in the field of cancer immunotherapy for many years and has been prominent in bringing cancer vaccines into mainstream research. 
					</p>
					<p>
						"My interest in cancer vaccines started many years ago when the idea arose that some cancers were caused by viruses. That led logically to the idea that it would be possible to raise an immune response against cancer and I became interested in vaccines. Over the course of my clinical career I have treated patients with experimental vaccines and it is very clear to me that for some patients these treatments work very well. The challenge is to understand why some patients respond and to develop more generic treatments which are applicable to all".

						Dan is a Postdoctoral Research Assistant whose research involves trying to explain how bacterial vaccines can be used to combat cancer. He originally joined the team as a technician but has worked through a part-time PhD to get his doctorate in 2011. 
					</p>
					<p>
						"My research, which I developed for my PhD thesis, is based on the idea that some bacteria are able to generate immune responses which are beneficial in cancer. In fact it is well known that the mycobacterium BCG, which most people remember from their skin tests at school, can be used to treat bladder cancer. I developed this idea that mycobacteria can stimulate a particular T cell type called gamma-delta cells. My research showed how mycobacteria interact with cells in the blood to stimulate these gamma-delta cells. More importantly these active gamma-delta cells are then able to kill tumour cells in culture. This work helps to explain which cells are important in response to mycobacterial vaccines which is important for some experimental treatments in cancer.

						Elwira is the second holder of the David Fine Memorial Studentship. Her work under this grant began in May 2011 and involves research which stems from observations made from the Dendritic Cell Vaccine trial that the CV! funded.

					<p>
						"When I arrived here, the team was looking at proteins in the blood of melanoma patients who had been treated with a dendritic cell vaccine. The initial results seemed to suggest that by measuring a range of proteins in the blood it is possible to predict whether a patient will respond to a vaccine. My work initially showed that some of those proteins were linked and generated new proteins to look at. My PhD work now revolves around one protein called ApoE which we think might influence how dendritic cells and the immune system behave."

					</p>
					<p>
						"I have worked in immunology for most of my career, and in immunotherapy reseach since about 1998. It has been interesting to see how immunotherapy has developed over that time. Perhaps 15 years ago a vaccine seemed a long way away, but things have really moved on. We understand so much better how the immune system responds to vaccines and, more importantly, how to raise immune responses against cancer. It will be interesting to look back on this in another 15 years' time. I really think that by then vaccines aid immunotherapy will play a key role in controlling cancer."

						Mark is a senior research fellow whose task is to supervise and guide the research team. 
					</p>
					<p>
						"When I first worked at St George's I became interested in how the immune system recognises dead and dying cells. We came up with this concept of "virtual viral infection", which essentially means that we make tumour cells look like they have a viral infection. That stimulates an immune response which targets other, non-treated tumour cells. My current interests have expanded on these earlier concepts to include studies of how dying tumour cells communicate with the immune system through exosomes and other factors. I am also interested in gamma-delta cells and have been very involved in Dan Fowler's work which we hope is the first stage in developing new immunotherapies for cancer."

					</p>
					<p>
						"I have principally been interested in how drugs alter immune responses. Perhaps most importantly I have shown how tumours treated with drugs respond by communicating in a different way with cells of the immune system. Drug-treated tumour cells are able to produce substances that alter denddtic cells and T cell responses. By studying these effects in culture we hope to shed light on what may be happening to patients' tumours and their immune systems. In this way we hope to develop better strategies to use both immunotherapy and chemotherapy together."
