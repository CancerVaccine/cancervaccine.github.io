Both projects revolve around the new heat killed non-specific vaccine based onMycobacterium vaccae, which Prof. Dalgleish has used for over 15 years with very good long-term results in melanoma. However, it has now become clear that it is not melanoma specific and many other cancers have responded well to it. It is being produced by Immodulon, who have committed all their resources to a randomised study but would make it available for these trials if the funds can be raised. Study for Men with Prostate Cancer

Following observations that people on the vaccine and Zometa, (a drug for bone pain and secondary cancers) seemed to do far better than expected, Prof Dalgleish and his team researched this combination in the lab, which showed they really did synergise.

They now wish to use this combination for men with prostate cancer with a rising PSA who would normally start on hormone therapy with all the unpleasant side effects ofthis treatment. Three eminent oncologists at UCH and Charing Cross as well as St George’s Hospital are very keen on this study. The cost of setting it up is &pound;130,000 and everything is in place to start when funds are available.

Study for Women with Ovarian Cancer

This disease is recognized as having an immunological deficient component and this specific vaccine has all the qualities that have not been tried before, correcting the cytokine deficiency but also boosting the natural innate immune response.&nbsp;

The vaccine would be used with an exciting drug called Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN). It was originally used to help opium addicts. The doctor looking after these patients noticed that patients with cancer had shrinkage in their tumours while on the LDN.

Again in the lab, the combination of LDN with the cancer vaccine has shown some exciting results. Indeed Prof Dalgleish has already used LDN on its’ own with some patients where no other treatment was available and they had been given months to live and the patients are still alive. It cost pence per tablet compared with most drugs and so if found to be successful would be well within the NHS to prescribe to anyone. The costs to kick start this trial will also be around &pound;130,000.

If documented evidence of response in these studies is produced, then the data will beused to sponsor larger studies and more people will benefit. Cancer vaccines have none of the side effects of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. It is a non-toxic way of enhancing the immune response that all cancers suppress, making an excellent first line treatment, which will improve responses to subsequent treatment modalities including radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

If funds become available, the CVI will begin running these trials in 2013.
