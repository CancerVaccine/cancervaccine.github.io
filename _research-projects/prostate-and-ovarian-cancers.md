“A double blind, randomized controlled trial of Mycobacterium obuense (IMM-101) versus placebo in men with localized prostate cancer managed with active surveillance”

**Scope and purpose**

Active surveillance is an increasingly popular alternative to immediate radical treatment for men with clinically localized, low-risk prostate cancer. Disease progression inevitably occurs in a proportion of such men. Mycobacterial preparations have demonstrated anti-tumour properties in experimental models and the purpose of this trial will be to determine whether Mycobacterium obuense (IMM-101) vaccination could delay disease progression in the active surveillance setting.
