The field of immunotherapy has lagged behind the rest of the Oncology field in discovering
new biomarkers specific to vaccine treatments. Biomarkers represent a way of understanding or
predicting what will happen to a patient when they are undergoing treatment. Biomarkers can
be a test which predicts the outcome of a type of treatment or which is used to diagnose a
tumour (for example PSA in prostate cancer).

A project is nearing its conclusion which is designed to discover biomarkers in the serum of
melanoma patients treated with a dendritic cell vaccine. Preliminary results suggest that
profiling a panel of proteins in the blood of vaccinated patients may predict which patients are
more likely to respond to vaccine. This would mean that patients could be assigned to correct
treatment groups and those with the correct profile would be more likely to benefit from their
vaccine. In an attempt to validate these observations we collaborated with several other groups
to secure samples from prostate cancer and melanoma patients undergoing similar
immunotherapy. Although the results from these other trials are not identical there is a trend
showing that non-responders have elevated inflammatory markers. This suggests that, in the
context of patients with melanoma, pre-treatment with an anti-inflammatory agent may
enhance responses to vaccines. Early studies suggest that this is the case. However, other
exciting data has emerged from these collaborations, particularly the observation that
Interleukin-15 may be found in greater amounts in prostate cancer patients who are likely to
respond better to immunotherapy.

A further discovery arising from the melanoma DC vaccine trial is the finding that the profile
of antibody subtypes in the serum may correspond to how well patients respond clinically to
the vaccine. Although we do not yet understand what this signifies, this observation is unique
and unexpected given the nature of the vaccine, and we are continuing with experiments to
discover the significance of these findings.

This is a relatively new and exciting area of research within the cancer immunotherapy field
and it is hoped that this work will result in better selection and treatment of patients in the
future.
