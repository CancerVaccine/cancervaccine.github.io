**The Effect of Chemotherapy Drugs on Immune Cells in Culture**

A number of recent studies suggest that some forms of chemotherapy are able to promote immune function. The CVI previously funded Dr Wai to do research in this area. His results, which were published in the British Journal of Cancer in 2010, demonstrated that the chemotherapy drugs Gemcitabine and Oxaliplatin, when used in sub-optimal (i.e. relatively non-toxic) doses, induce changes in tumour cells that are likely to alter the way that they are seen by the immune system. Gemcitabine is a drug which is currently used for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. It has also been shown to improve responses to cancer vaccines in an experimental setting suggesting that the drug alters immune responses in some way. For this reason we are continuing the work initiated by Dr Liu to look in more detail at the changes in tumour cells caused by Gemcitabine. The data is still preliminary but it appears that Gemcitabine alters different aspects of tumour biology. These alterations are very likely to skew how the immune system recognises tumours, but we need to collect more data to prove this. Ultimately it is hoped that understanding how Gemcitabine alters tumours will lead to its use in combination with vaccines.
