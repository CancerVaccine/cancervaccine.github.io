title: The Steven Bryn Ellis Tribute Fund
---


#### To all of Steve’s friends

Steve was an amazing guy, always strong, always positive and with never a bad word to say about anyone. This may sound like our biased family opinion but from the many tributes that are pouring in we know that so many others also share our view. You have all expressed shock and sadness at his passing but also conveyed, with such warmth, the respect and love with which you regarded him as he was a best friend to many!

Steve was first diagnosed in June 2006, from that moment until his death in May 2010 he never once sought self-pity or special treatment, he used to say that “I’m only ill when I’m in the hospital, otherwise lets just enjoy ourselves and get on with life”. Steve truly lived life to the full, putting so much energy and enthusiasm into everything that he did. Together with Liz they ensured that every moment was a moment to be treasured, whether that was on one of their many travels (14 different countries at the last count) or simply a night in watching DVDs and eating fish & chips.

Steve left a letter for his family and we’d like to share an excerpt with you as it not only illustrates his strength of character and positivity but also sets us a challenge:-

"You control how you react to different situations and I ask you to react positively to this one and every one that you face. Please pass on my future best wishes to those who I met and cared for, and those who cared for me. I thank them too for every little bit of my life that they contributed to"

We’d like to share with you Steve’s challenge, to turn his experience into a positive (as he did), by asking you to donate in Steve’s memory to the valuable work being done by Professor Dalgleish. While in hospital, Steve received the most amazing care from so many medical professionals (too many to mention - thank you all) but ‘the Prof’ was always there, always positive, always ready with an alternative treatment. His support gave Steve and his family great hope and enabled them to enjoy the last 4 years of Steve’s life.

Professor Dalgleish and his team are working on various aspects of improving the survival rate of melanoma patients including; dendritic cell vaccines, many alternative treatments to boost the immune response to kill cancer cells, and the use of chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy. Your donations will allow Professor Dalgleish to continue with his invaluable work to save lives from this awful disease and give other families hope.

Steve’s family would like to say thank you for all the anonymous cash donations, received by the undertakers, in memory of Steve. These amounted to &pound;467.00.

Steve’s family have been supporting the Cancer Vaccine Institute through various fundraising initiatives and have so far raised over **&pound;26,000.00**

* **Roy Lightfoot -&nbsp;**Iwas lucky to have lovely grandchildren. Steve was the one I saw most and I treasure so many happy memories. Thank you from grandpa.
* **Patricia Angel -&nbsp;**We are proud to have been aunt, uncle and cousins to Steve. He was a modest, helpful young man who always had a twinkle in his eye. He was much loved by all our family and he enjoyed even the company of me his aunt, joining me dog walking and even coming with me to a predominantly female aerobics class! Steve was always interesting and was lively company and would often send his own postcards from his travels, using his own holiday photos and often thanking for various presents which he had received. Since being diagnosed, Steve was most courageous and demonstrated an incredibly positive attitude, still with thoughts of others uppermost in his mind: He often would thank me for coming to visit him and for keeping his mum company. We al miss Steve greatly and the World will be a poorer place without him.

* **Heather Lister -&nbsp;**Sue, Nigel & Barry - I didn’t have the pleasure of meeting Steve, but I have heard so many wonderful things about him over the years from Sue; what an inspiring, fantastic young man. Words are never enough…… my thoughts with you all. Heather, David, Stephen & Michael.

* **Keith Windram -&nbsp;**Over recent years I have worked closely with Steve and spent many weeks abroad to some of the countries he loved to visit. His great positive outlook on all things was an inspiration to all. We shared many long days and nights travelling and working, but he always still found time and energy to enjoy every moment and importantly have some fun. As well as being exceptionally smart and good at his job, he was an extremely nice person and great company. My thoughts are with his family and Liz ad I know from the tributes I have received from colleagues, friends and clients we all share the belief that we are better people for having known him.
* **Guy Heather -&nbsp;**Sue, Nigel & Barry, our thoughts are with you. I get the impression that Steve lived more in his short life than a lot of people do who reach old age - inspirational. Wishing the Professor every success in his work. Love Guy, Lisa & William
* **Andrew Pierce -&nbsp;**A small token from work colleagues at Honeywell in St Asaph
* **Rich Brady -&nbsp;**I haven’t seen Steve for many years, but was instantly saddened at the news. Then smiled as I remembered him teaching me some Stereophics chords on my shitty guitar on a long bus trip to the Alps on our 6th Form Ski Trip.
* **Howard Cardus -&nbsp;**Such a good friend and a great loss.
* Arabella VolkersI thought you would prefer the money for the ‘plane ticket to go to support CVI instead, Steve. That’s just you: simply thinking of others first. A lovely friend and colleague.
* **Rachel Corner -&nbsp;**Such a sad loss to all who knew him. x
* **Roger Warner -&nbsp;**Steve was an inspiration to us all and will be truly missed.

* **Tim & Gill Allen -&nbsp;**Steven was amazing guy and brilliant friend. It was an honour to have had Steven as a friend. He will be missed!

Our thoughts are with Sue, Nigel, Barry, Liz & the rest of the family. RIP Steve.
* **Jenny Angel -&nbsp;**Steve lived more than most people would in 5 lifetimes in his 29 years. He had a happy, adventure and fun-filled life surrounded by people that loved him, family and friends. He had travelled the world & excelled at a variety of sports. Even as a child he was good at everything he tried. He was amazingly fit running, cycling, climbing & windsurfing the mountains and lakes of North Wales where he grew up. A 20 mile run was a short walk for him. He was cheeky & up for a laugh but sensitive & kind at the same time which drew everyone to him & made them love him although we should really have been jealous of such an amazing young man. I hasve known Steve most of my life & always enjoyed my holidays spending time with him & his family on his farm in Wales. They all helped to make him the special person he was. Steve was always up to some antic or other. Things were never boring with him around. It is a shame all our time with him has been cut short. Things won’t be the same without him to share the fun times although he will always be in our minds.
