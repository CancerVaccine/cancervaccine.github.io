<div class="container"><div class="row"><h2>Donations so far: &pound;1,754.63</h2><p>Professor Catherine Wilson</p><p>Professor Catherine Wilson was a big personality with a generous heart, sharp curiosity and lust for life.&nbsp; A respected research scientist, specializing in neuro-reproductive physiology, my mother received her first degree in Pharmacy before moving into the pharmaceutical industry in the early 1960s.&nbsp; Probably bored by the lack of exploration, she soon turned back to research science, gained her PhD in 1964 and secured her first Lecturer post at Chelsea College.&nbsp; Trailblazing for women in science, positions at the Royal Vet College followed before she joined St Georges Hospital in 1982 as Senior Lecturer.&nbsp; She had taken the first Basic Science post within a clinical dept (Obstetrics and Gynaecology) at the hospital.&nbsp; She worked there until she died in 2010, becoming a Professor Emeritus in 2004.</p><p>&nbsp;Alongside her academic career, Catherine was also an accomplished and passionate artist.&nbsp; Many of her pictures of vegetables, flowers, trees and landscapes can be seen hanging in the houses of her friends and colleagues.&nbsp; Like her science and art, she also loved food, travel, books and parties.&nbsp; Her reputation for science is rivaled by her reputation as a hostess and bon viveur.</p><p>&nbsp;Catherine was diagnosed with cancer in 2006 and typical to her, she embarked on her treatments with zeal, determination and curiosity.&nbsp; After her initial chemotherapy, she went in search of Prof Dalgleish along the corridors of St Georges.&nbsp; She took on the cancer vaccine treatment he suggested with optimism and enthusiasm, especially when he said she could continue to have a glass of wine.&nbsp; Although ill health eventually took over my mother&rsquo;s life, we believe that the cancer vaccine treatment added three years to her life (she had been given a prognosis of one year).&nbsp; These were a precious three years to her, her family and her vast array of friends who all miss her greatly.</p><p>&nbsp;- Natalie Wilson</p><p>Messages from the donors</p><p>Debra Ramsay<br />In loving memory of my Aunt Catherine.
