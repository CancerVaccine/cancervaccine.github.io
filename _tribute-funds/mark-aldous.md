Mark was a fantastic husband and also a brilliant father to his twin sons, Billy and Archie. He was a enormous character, full of charm and fun with a naughty sense of humour. Mark had many, many friends who still miss him and his main love apart from his family was fishing, cooking and nature.

He died tragically young, aged 41 on November 19th 2005 after fighting malignant melanoma for three years. Professor Dalgleish was our one ray of hope when all the doctors had given up on him and I firmly believe that Gusâ€™s vaccine gave us an extra six months together - for our sons, who were only six when their father died this was so important.

This pioneering treatment is vital to support and I hope that one day it might result in a cure for this horrible and unpredictable disease.
