### Donations so far: &pound;385.00

Edwin is a much-missed and dearly loved Husband, Father, Grandfather and friend.

He first met Professor Dalgleish back in December 2000 when,having undergone several unsuccessful surgical operations to attempt to remove malanoma cells, there was little hope that he would survive. However after undergoing a course of vaccine therapy and radiotherapy, Edwin returned to his previous good health and was given the gift of another 11 years of life.

Edwinâ€™s annual check-up with Professor Dalgleish was always a nerve-racking day, but he was always given a clean bill of health after each appointment.

In fact Edwin eventually passed away due to an unrelated illness, but his family and friends were always grateful to Professor Dalgleish and the Cancer Vaccine Institute for the extra time that they gave them with him.
