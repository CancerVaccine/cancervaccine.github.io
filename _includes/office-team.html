					<h3>Abi Parry-Williams, Fundraising Assistant </h3>
					<p>Whilst this is Abi's first job in the charity sector, she has always been involved in fundraising â€” from doing a 24 hour sponsored fast as a teenager, to completing the London to Brighton Bike Ride 4 times! Having had a break of 7 years to raise her two children, she was keen to take a job that felt really worthwhile and finds that working for the Cancer Vaccine Institute for the last 6 months has certainly been that.</p>

					<h3>Lucy Deville</h3>
					<p>
						Lucy was Appeal Director at St George's Hospital where a successful fundraising appeal raised funds for cancer vaccine research. 
					</p>
					<p>
						This early research showed such promise that she was delighted to be asked to help with founding the CVI as an independent charity. 
						She works as Secretary to the Trustees, co-ordinates the Peer Review process for research projects and monitors projects funded by the CVI at other centres.
