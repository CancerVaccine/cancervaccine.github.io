				<p>
				    After achieving my Bachelor’s degree in Biology at Southampton University in 2005, I joined the ICVI team as a research technician in Prof. Dalgleish's laboratory at St George's, making dendritic cell vaccines for melanoma patients.  With funding from the ICVI, I was able to do a part-time PhD, which focused on investigating the anti-tumour responses of a particular immune cell called gamma-delta T cells.  After my PhD I then began to look at how gamma-delta cells interacted with other immune cells, called macrophages, which are thought to accumulate in tumours and facilitate tumour growth. I am currently investigating how the drug Zometa can help gamma-delta T cells kill these macrophages, and whether the drug can potentially clear these macrophages from patient tumours. If it can, then this will add treatment options for cancer patients, particularly those with melanoma or prostate cancer.  Professor Dalgleish has long been interested in mycobacteria (which also stimulate gamma-delta T cells) as treatments for cancer and the research I am doing, along with that of Joe and Emma below, is inspired by this. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I am really grateful to the ICVI for all the funding I have received over the past 10 years for my immunotherapy research, and am delighted to be making so much progress.

                    I became interested in immunotherapy whilst studying for my Bachelor’s degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology at the University of Bath.  I started working at St George’s as a technician but am now registered for a full time PhD.  My research is looking at tuberculosis infection as well as cancer – areas in which I believe there may be some interesting overlaps.  My post is jointly funded by ICVI and Health Protection England.
				</p>
				<p>
	                I am looking at how T-cells use a protein called a T-cell Receptor (TCR) to recognize a vast number of different targets including cancer and tuberculosis infected cells.  My project aims to characterize those cells that are able to respond to cancer or tuberculosis in terms of the TCR they express as well as their other characteristics.   With this information we may be able to better understand the properties of gamma delta T-cells that are able to recognize and kill cancer cells and to design therapies that harness these cells.  This could be an exciting advance in the treatment of cancer.  				
				</p>
				<p>
					I would like to thank the ICVI and everyone who fundraises for the charity, because your support enables me to carry out this really important research, which I hope will be published within the next year or two.

                    I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Biochemistry at Imperial College, and then went on to do a Master’s degree in Immunology of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  I started my PhD at SGUL in October 2013, and am studying how gamma-delta T cells interact with tumours and other cells of the immune system. My project focuses specifically on a molecule called Granulysin which is a protein secreted by gamma delta T cells, and my project aims to understand its function.  I am studying how Granulysin might induce other immune cells to move to the site of the tumour. In this way Granulysin might be an important regulator of immune responses to tumours.  I was drawn to the project as I am very interested in finding ways in which the body's own immune system can be used to fight cancer, especially as current treatments for cancer will not always work and come with a wide range of side effects and other disadvantages. I also really loved the translational research aspect of the project - that there is a potential for discoveries made during my project to help towards getting a new treatment for cancer into the clinic.  Potentially, any cancer which is susceptible to immunotherapy, including renal, lung, prostate, pancreatic and colorectal could benefit from this research, and that’s really exciting.

                    I read Biochemistry at the University of Bath, following which I started working for the ICVI at St George’s as a research technician.  During my time at St George’s, I’ve researched dendritic cell vaccination of melanoma patients, the anti-cancer properties of newly synthesised anti-malarial compounds and the feasibility of immunotherapy/chemotherapy combinations. I am now studying for a part time PhD.  My work focuses on the drug Gemcitabine, a chemotherapeutic agent which has been used for some years in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.  Several years ago I did some research which indicated that Gemcitabine has some immunological effects on tumour cells. Specifically it increases the amount of a molecule called “MHC class I” on a range of tumour cells in culture. This is a potentially important observation since this molecule is what allows T cells to recognise and kill tumour cells.
				</p>
				<p>
					My project has shown several key features of tumour cell responses to Gemcitabine which we hope to publish soon.  This work could have a real impact on how cancer patients are treated in the future.
				</p>
				<p>
					My work, and that of Thanu is inspired by Professor Dalgleish’s interest in combination therapies; he has long believed that immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy is an effective cancer treatment.
				</p>
				<p>
					None of my work would have been possible without the efforts of the supporters of the ICVI and I am really grateful to you all.

                    I am interested in understanding the human immune system and how it is often challenged during conditions such as cancer.  My Biomedical Science degree at St George’s followed by a Master’s at King’s further fuelled this curiosity, and I began working for the ICVI research team in October 2014.  I am a research technician who is working on the effects of the drug Zometa on tumour cells.
				</p>
				<p>
					Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are used to kill growing cancer cells but not all cells are destroyed. Over 50 years ago, a small group of cells called cancer stem cells were found within various cancer populations. These cells have the ability to resist cancer treatments, thus they proliferate and repopulate cancers. My work involves characterising these cells in colorectal, lung and prostate cancers in addition to identifying how differently they respond to Zometa. This is a drug that has previously been used in prostate cancer patients to prevent problems they develop with weak bones. We are studying the re-purposing of this drug to manipulate the immune system.  The question here is whether the stem cell population possesses a distinctive immune profile when compared to non-stem cells and whether Zometa can be used to modify that immune profile. If cancer stem cells are different to normal cancer cells, we can target both types of cells with conventional cancer therapies combined with immunotherapy – and decrease the likelihood of cancer relapse.

                    My career began at Newcastle University where I graduated with a degree in Medical Microbiology and Immunology in 2012. Following my graduation, I continued to work in a research lab at Newcastle University where I became interested in research on the immune system. It was this which led me to start my PhD at St George’s in 2013 where I am studying the effect the drug Naltrexone on the immune system. Naltrexone is currently being used by some patients as an off-label treatment to cancer and autoimmune diseases but there is little evidence to support its use as a standard treatment. Hopefully, my current work for my PhD will help develop our understanding of how the drug works and provide scientific evidence to support Naltrexone’s use in cancer patients.   I am immensely grateful to the ICVI for selecting me as the first beneficiary of the Nicholas Freeman Studentship, named after one of the founding trustees of the charity.  My work has been inspired by Professor Dalgleish and some of his patients’ experiences of Naltrexone which convinced him that it has an immunological component.  I am delighted that my work has been patented and licenced, as this has raised some money which has been ploughed straight back into the charity’s research.

                    I am a clinical research fellow who joined University College London’s Urology Research Group in October 2015.  In the past I have worked as a Urology Registrar at the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children and also completed an MSc on Molecular Medicine at Imperial College.  I am running a clinical trial for patients with prostate cancer.  A large part of this project is funded by the Institute for Cancer Vaccines and Immunotherapy, and was raised by a ball held by Angela Feather in 2012.  Other costs for the project were raised by donations sent in by ICVI supporters in response to Professor Dalgleish’s Christmas appeal last year.  I would like to thank Angela and all of you who contributed to this trial, the first the ICVI has been able to run for some years.
