Two projects have just finished which aim to improve our understanding of the best ways to promote dendritic cell stimulation.&nbsp;

The first David Fine Memorial PhD studentship finished in October 2010. This work aimed to understand events that occur during the death of tumour cells treated with two drugs that stimulate the immune system; double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and Interferon-gamma. These drugs induce tumour cells to die, but more importantly the dying tumour cells influence the stimulation and maturation of dendritic cells. During the course of the work the following observations were made. (1) Not all tumour cells are susceptible to this treatment unless a further process is undertaken to get dsRNA into the cell (known as electroporation). (2) The dying tumour cells release a number of factors which may be important in influencing dendritic cell stimulation. (3) Dendritic cell take up dying tumour cells, an event that is likely to be important in promoting further immune responses by T cells.

The CVI also provided funding for a post-doctoral scientist for one year to look for immune responses to tumour cells treated with dsRNA and interferon. This work was recently published in the journal Cancer Immunology Immunotherapy. Ultimately it is likely that this work can be translated to the clinic either in the form of a vaccine or using drugs, such as Hiltonol, that stimulate the immune system in a similar way.

More recently a funding was agreed for the second David Fine Memorial studentship. This project aims to investigate the effects of ApoE1 on the activity of dendritic cells. The studentship began in may 2011.
