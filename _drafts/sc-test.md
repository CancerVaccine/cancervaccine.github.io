It looks to me like PATH lists the first-generation dependencies directly from your gemspec, whereas GEM lists second-generation dependencies (i.e. what your dependencies depend on) and those from your Gemfile. PATH::remote is .&nbsp;because it relied on a local gemspec in the current directory to find out what belongs in PATH::spec, whereas GEM::remote is rubygems.org, since that's where it had to go to find out what belongs in GEM::spec.

In a Rails plugin, you'll see a PATH section, but not in a Rails app. Since the app doesn't have a gemspec file, there would be nothing to put in PATH.

As for DEPENDENCIES, gembundler.com states:

Runtime dependencies in your gemspec are treated like base dependencies, and development dependencies are added by default to the group, :development

The Gemfile generated by rails plugin new my_plugin says something similar:

# Bundler will treat runtime dependencies like base dependencies, and # development dependencies will be added by default to the :development group.

What this means is that the difference between

s.add_development_dependency "july" # (1)

and
