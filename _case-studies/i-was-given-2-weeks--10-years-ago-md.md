![](/uploads/versions/img-0871-1---x----3712-2712x---.jpg)Standing hand on hip one day in 2006 I felt a lump the size of a grape on my right side.  I knew it would change everything.

It wasn’t the first time.  Aged 26 I was diagnosed with a melanoma.  Thankfully, the cancer hadn’t spread and the mole was removed.  At each annual checkup I began to relax.  By the time I felt the lump I’d been cancer free for fifteen years.

Later, scans showed that the cancer had spread to my lips, throat, liver and lungs and doctors told me I had weeks to live.  I had no future.  I remember gazing at my garden and thinking I would never see it flower again.  Then doctors told me they wanted to try something new.  Professor Dalgleish, whose research is funded by ICVI, was trialling a then little known treatment called immunotherapy.  I First I was given chemotherapy to reduce the tumours, then he put me on a three month course of chemotherapy where I was injected three times a week.  Miraculously, by January 2007, scans showed that all the cancer had gone.

Almost ten years on I am still monitored each year but am able to make plans again and watch my garden grow!  I also got married recently.   I am so grateful to the research carried out by the ICVI and give thanks every day for my new life free from cancer.
