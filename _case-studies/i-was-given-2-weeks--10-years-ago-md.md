Standing hand on hip one day in 2006 I felt a lump the size of a grape on my right side.&nbsp; I knew it would change everything.

It wasn’t the first time.&nbsp; Aged 26 I was diagnosed with a melanoma.&nbsp; Thankfully, the cancer hadn’t spread and the mole was removed.&nbsp; At each annual checkup I began to relax.&nbsp; By the time I felt the lump I’d been cancer free for fifteen years.

Later, scans showed that the cancer had spread to my lips, throat, liver and lungs and doctors told me I had weeks to live.&nbsp; I had no future.&nbsp; I remember gazing at my garden and thinking I would never see it flower again.&nbsp; Then doctors told me they wanted to try something new.&nbsp; Professor Dalgleish, whose research is funded by ICVI, was trialling a then little known treatment called immunotherapy.&nbsp; I First I was given chemotherapy to reduce the tumours, then he put me on a three month course of immunotherapy where I was injected three times a week.&nbsp; Miraculously, by January 2007, scans showed that all the cancer had gone.

Almost ten years on I am still monitored each year but am able to make plans again and watch my garden grow!&nbsp; I also got married recently.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am so grateful to the research carried out by the ICVI and give thanks every day for my new life free from cancer.
