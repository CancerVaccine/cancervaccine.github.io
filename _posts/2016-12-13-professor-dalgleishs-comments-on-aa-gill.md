Following the recent death of  journalist  AA Gill from a very aggressive form of lung cancer which had only been diagnosed a few weeks ago, his struggle to access new treatments on the NHS and in particular Immunotherapy has been in the news.

The ICVI, the charity of which I am principal, has been researching immunotherapy and vaccines as a treatment for cancer for 20 years.   Larger charities have recently become interested in this field and so you may have read about developments in the newspapers recently.

Immunotherapy as a treatment for cancer  describes the active stimulation of the immune system to recognise and kill cancer cells which have escaped the normal surveillance mechanisms of the immune system which continually fights off infections and when overwhelmed results merely in colds and the flu most of the time. Cancers as they evolve actively suppress the immune system that has the capacity to kill them.

Immunotherapy has been around for several decades and has involved special vaccines and cytokines ( special immune messenger molecules ) such as interferon and interleukin 2, both of which have previously been hailed as potential cancer cures. Slowly, step by step, small advances have been made in the treatment of melanoma culminating in the use of antibodies, known collectively as check point inhibitors which have led to  a significant increase in survival in advanced melanoma patients.

These drugs are known as Ipilimumab, Nivolimumab and Pembrolizumab. These drugs ARE now available on the NHS for advanced melanoma patients.  Because the way these drugs work are not specifically aimed at melanoma but rather release the brakes on the suppressed immune response, they have been tried in other tumour types and have been shown to be effective in some types of lung cancer and once again some have been approved on the NHS for treatment.

It would appear that there was a special case made for one of these drugs for AA Gill which he did eventually receive, the delay may have been due to the detail about whether his cancer was the type already approved for NHS use or not. ( I suspect it was not the type approved, hence the delay)

Nevertheless , this should not detract from the fact that the idea of an immunotherapy being available on the NHS a few years ago would have been unimaginable.  Not only are some drugs already available on the NHS but there are now 100’s of trials with different types of immunotherapy in late stage trials, involving many tumour types literally from head to toe. I believe the real future of these drugs is combining them in the correct combinations and sequence relative to other treatment types such as surgery and chemotherapy. In the future Immunotherapy will be available for most cancers and will contribute to a significant improvement of outcome.

However, one important fact is these treatments are VERY EXPENSIVE at up to £100K a year. The NHS now spends over a £1Billion on just 4 drugs.

With the expected increase in demand it will be unsustainable at these prices and  now is the time to address how future treatments are going to be paid for.

Nevertheless, the breakthroughs and improvements in applying immunotherapy to cancer treatments bodes very well for completely rewriting the management of cancer in the future and I am proud that the work of ICVI is focussing on combining non-toxic affordable treatments that can be applied to the majority of cancer types.  I would urge you to please, if at all possible, make a commitment to donate on a regular basis to ensure that we can continue with our work.
