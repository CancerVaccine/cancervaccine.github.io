        <h2>Welcome to the Cancer Vaccine Institute!</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          The Cancer Vaccine Institute is the only national charity in the UK devoted exclusively to funding research into the use
          of cancer immunotherapy as a treatment for cancer. Larger cancer charities have recently become interested in this
          field and so you may have read about developments in the newspapers recently.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
          Our Principal, Professor Angus Dalgeish, has been interested in cancer immunotherapy for many years and since 2000 funds
          raised by CVI have enabled him to setup a small team of researchers at St Georgeâ€™s Hospital in London. We were
          the first charity to fund research into cancer immunotherapy and believe it is the future of cancer research.
