          <p class="lead">
            The Cancer Vaccine Institute is the only national charity in the UK devoted exclusively to funding research into the use
            of cancer immunotherapy as a treatment for cancer. Larger cancer charities have recently become interested in this
            field and so you may have read about developments in the newspapers recently.
          </p>
  
          <p class="lead">
            Our Principal, Professor Angus Dalgeish, has been interested in cancer immunotherapy for many years and since 2000 funds
            raised by CVI have enabled him to setup a small team of researchers at St Georgeâ€™s Hospital in London. We were
            the first charity to fund research into cancer immunotherapy and believe it is the future of cancer research.
