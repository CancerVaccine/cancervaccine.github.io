<p>The Cancer Vaccine Institute (CVI) funds research into the use of vaccines and
  immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer. Our vision is that cancer vaccines
  will become a standard treatment and improve survival rates and patients’
  quality of life for a wide range of cancers.</p>

<p>Thank you for your interest in the Cancer Vaccine Institute.</p>

<p>Following press stories about charities who share their donors' details with
  other charities and agencies, we want to reassure all our supporters that we
  have not and will not ever do this.  Nor do we send our unsolicited letters or
  emails or make cold calls to supporters. </p>

<p>We are a small charity which has to work hard to raise the £600,000 needed
  each year to continue our research work. All our income comes from voluntary
  sources.</p>
