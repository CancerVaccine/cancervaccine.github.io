        The Cancer Vaccine Institute is the only national charity in the UK devoted exclusively
        to funding research into the use of cancer immunotherapy as a treatment for cancer.
        Larger cancer charities have recently become interested in this field and so you may
        have read about developments in the newspapers recently. Our Principal, Professor Angus
        Dalgeish, has been interested in cancer immunotherapy for many years and since 2000 funds
        raised by CVI have enabled him to setup a small team of researchers at St Georgeâ€™s
        Hospital in London. We were the first charity to fund research into cancer
        immunotherapy and believe it is the future of cancer research.
