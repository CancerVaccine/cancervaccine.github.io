      <h2>Welcome to the Cancer Vaccine Institute!</h2>
      <p>
        The Cancer Vaccine Institute is the only national charity in the UK devoted exclusively
        to funding research into the use of cancer immunotherapy as a treatment for cancer.
        Larger cancer charities have recently become interested in this field and so you may
        have read about developments in the newspapers recently.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our Principal, Professor Angus
        Dalgeish, has been interested in cancer immunotherapy for many years and since 2000 funds
        raised by CVI have enabled him to setup a small team of researchers at St Georgeâ€™s
        Hospital in London. We were the first charity to fund research into cancer
        immunotherapy and believe it is the future of cancer research.
